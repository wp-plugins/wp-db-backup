WP-DB-Backup allows you to easily backup your core WordPress database tables.  You may also optionally backup other tables in the same database.

Released under the terms of the GNU GPL, version 2.
   http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html

              NO WARRANTY.

== Installation ==
1. Create a directory /wp-content/backup/ inside your WordPress directory.
2. Make this directory writable by your webserver.
   For example:
   $ cd wordpress/wp-content
   $ mkdir backup
   $ chgrp www-data backup
   $ chmod g+w backup
3. Install and activate wp-db-backup.php

== Usage ==
1) Click the Manage menu in your WordPress admin area.
2) Click the Backup sub-menu.

The following core WordPress tables will be included in every backup:
* wp_categories
* wp_comments
* wp_linkcategories
* wp_links
* wp_options
* wp_post2cat
* wp_postmeta
* wp_posts
* wp_users
(Where "wp_" will automatically be replaced by whatever table prefix you use.)

3) The plugin will look for other tables in the same database.  You may elect to include other tables in the backup.
  ** NOTE **
  Including other tables in your backup may substantially increase the
  size of the backup, which may in turn cause several problems:
  * PHP may run out of memory
  * PHP may run out of time
  * emailing the backup may fail because it's too big

4) Select how you'd like the backup to be delivered:
* None : this will create a file in /wp-content/backup/ for you to retreive later
* Email : this will email the backup file to the address you specify
* Download : this will send the backup file to your browser to be downloaded

5) Optionally elect to have the backup gzip.  This is strongly recommended.
6) Click "Backup!" and your database backup will be delivered to you.

The filename of the backup file will be of the form
   DB_prefix_date.sql
DB = the name of your WordPress database, as defined in wp-config.php
prefix = the table prefix for this WordPress blog, as defined in wp-config.php
date = CCYYmmdd_B format:  20050711_039
       the "B" is the internet "Swatch" time.  
       See the PHP date() function for details.

When having the database backup emailed or sent to your browser for immediate download, the backup file will be _deleted_ from the server when the transfer is finished.  Only if you select delivery method "None" will the backup file remain on your server.

   *** SECURITY WARNING ***
   Your database backup contains sensitive information,
   and should not be left on the server for any extended
   period of time.  The "None" delivery method is provided
   as a convenience only.  I will not accept any responsibility
   if other people obtain your backup file.
   *** SECURITY WARNING ***

== Advanced ==
Included with this plugin is a supplemental plugin, wp-cron-db-backup.php, which makes use of my WP-Cron plugin:
   http://www.skippy.net/blog/2005/05/26/plugin-wp-cron/

If you also have installed and activated  WP-Cron, you will have another set of options available at Manage -> Backup.

Here you can schedule automated backups of your core WordPress tables, and have them emailed to the address of your choice.

   ONLY the core WordPress tables will be backed up
   no plugin tables will be included.

This backup will occur once per day. To disable, select "None" for the schedule.
